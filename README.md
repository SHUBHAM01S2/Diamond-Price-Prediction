# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction using XGBoost Regressor

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the prices of diamonds using the **XGBoost Regressor** model. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various regression metrics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Diamond prices depend on several key features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. In this project:

- We use the **XGBoostRegressor** algorithm to build a predictive model.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Percentage-based error for better interpretability.

---

## 🔍 Results

The model performed well with:
- High R² Score
- Low MAE & MAPE values

These metrics show the model is capable of making accurate predictions on unseen diamond data.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model comparison with Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Web app deployment using Streamlit
